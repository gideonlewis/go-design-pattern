# Design Patterns in Golang
In this repository, you will find examples of popular design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Decorator, Observer, and many more. Each example comes with a detailed description of how to apply that design pattern in Golang, along with reference materials so that you can better understand them.

## Creational Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    <summary> Factory Method</summary>
    Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
